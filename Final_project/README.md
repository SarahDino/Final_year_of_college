# Personal Identification System with Deep Learning and Cancelable Biometrics (Graduation Project)ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains the research materials for my graduation project, which is identification system using deep learning and cancelable biometrics.

This project addresses the limitations of traditional password-based authentication by proposing a more secure and user-friendly system. It utilizes deep learning for feature extraction from biometric data (face and fingerprint) and incorporates cancelable biometrics to enhance data privacy.

The repository is organized as follows:

Research.pdf: This document details the complete research. <br>
Summary.md: This file provides a concise overview of the research, highlighting key concepts and findings. <br>
Presentation.pdf: A presentation summarizing the project. <br>
