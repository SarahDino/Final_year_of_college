working together was beautiful and enjoyable. 

Introduction: Personal identification can be achieved using biometrics recognition which has emerged as a reliable approach for automated human identification and is attracting significant
attention from the researchers. we propose the development of a reliable personal identification system which is based on cancelable biometrics and distributed deep learning.

Problem Statement & Significance :
The concept of the biometric is the automated recognition of human individuals based on their biological and behavioral traits. Because sometimes People forgetting their passwords
even their personal identifications such as national id, license .
To Secure personal identification and biomatrices: fingerprint and face ID are safer than password. It’s not easy to hack and if it hacked, we can cancelable Biometrics and change the
encryption of the biometric.

We will use Personal identification using cancelable biometrics and deep learning to solve this problem by using the face identification (Multi-biometrics) to make people lives easer
so they don’t have to remember every password they have and their personal identification will be more secure and safe because of cancelable biometric it has two category biometrics
authentication compares data for the person's characteristics to that person's biometric  "template" to determine resemblance .The data stored is then compared to the person's biometric data to be authenticated.

Biometric identification consists of determining the identity of a person. This data is then compared to the biometric data of several other persons kept in a database. 
Cancelable Biometric template is generated using some technique such as Hashing, Filtering, Cryptography, etc. These templates are then stored in the database.

In general, the cancelable biometrics can be used to make sure your biometrics has much higher security, because cancelable will secure and safe your biometric.

Deep learning methods learn features from data which help to generalize for other related tasks. Various correlated factors are disentangled in these learned features compared to
hand-engineered features which are designed to be invariant to such factors. Face recognition can be formulated as a verification or identification problem. In verification
mode, we verify whether a person is who he claims to be by comparing a person’s face to his previously collected gallery images. In identification mode, a person’s face is compared
with the gallery images of all individuals to establish a person’s identity.

The objective of our project to use the maximum advantage of this technology to make our lives easier.

Proposed Solution (System): In this project, we will propose a system for personal identification which can be used to access to a bank remotely. The system will make use of multi-biometrics,
cancelable templates, and deep learning. 

Biometrics: are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics

Personal identification: is defined as establishing the identity of an individual

There are two types of biometrics: Physical biometrics and Behavioral biometrics.

Physical biometrics refers to physiological features on the human body that can serve as identification, analyze data such as facial features, eye structure (retina or iris), finger parameters. Physical biometrics have become widespread, for example, access control to smartphones and laptops

Physiological measurements: 1-face recognition technique is applications that identify or verify a person automatically from a digital image or a video frame from a video
source. Facial metric technology relies on the manufacture of the specific face recognition feature, such as the position of eyes, nose and mouth, and distances between these features.

2-Eye (Iris) recognition: Iris recognition or iris scanning is the process of using visible and near-infrared light to take a high-contrast photograph of a person's iris.

3-Fingerprint Recognition: allows a person to be verified or identified through the analysis and comparison of his or her finger dermal ridges.

Advantages and disadvantages of Physical Biometrics:

-Advantages:
1- An identifier is inseparable from a person; it cannot be forgotten, lost, or passed on, no one can forget their face or hand or finger or eye.
2- It is quite difficult to recreate an identifier but it’s not impossible.
3- The process of biometric identification is fast and completely performed by computers.

-Disadvantages:
1- Situations can arise where biometric identifiers are damaged or unavailable for reading.
2- For many biometric identification systems, biometric scanners are quite expensive.
3- It is necessary to comply with the requirements of regulators for the protection of personal biometric data

BEHAVIOLAR BIOMETRICS: is the field of study related to the measure of uniquely identifying and measurable patterns in human activities in a person so the algorithm can identify the person by 
their behavioral pattern.

BEHAVIORAL MEASUREMENTS: behavioral characteristics that related to the pattern of people doing something, such as signature, typing, and mouse movement.

1-The signature recognition: is based on the dynamics of making the signature, rather than a direct comparison of the signature itself afterwards. The dynamic is measured as a mean of the pressure,
direction, acceleration and the length of the strikes, and dynamic number of strokes and their duration.

2-Typing Recognition: The use of the unique characteristics of a person’s typing for establishing identity

3- Gait recognition: The use of an individual’s walking style or gait to determine identity.

Advantages and disadvantages of Behavioral Biometrics:

-Advantages:
1- Individual user set of analyzed behavioral characteristics
2- No custom script change is required to perform identification: seamless integration method.

-Disadvantages:
1-Inaccuracies in identification may arise because the user's behavior is not always constant since they can behave differently in various situations due to fatigue,
drunkenness, feeling unwell or trivial haste.
2-Requires lots of personal data to determine a user's standard behavior. Also, it’s not wildly used.

Cancelable Biometrics Definition: One advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. 
This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it.
If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature.
Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system.

2- CANCELABLE BIOMETRIC TEMPLATES: strategies for generating cancelable biometric templates. In these methods, a function that is dependent on some parameter is used to generate protected
biometric templates. The parameter of the function is used as the key.

Cryptography based methods 
Definition: Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and
transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or
alteration but can also be used for user authentication.

Description: Earlier cryptography was effectively synonymous with encryption but nowadays cryptography is mainly based on mathematical theory and computer
science practice.

Modern cryptography concerns with:
Confidentiality - Information cannot be understood by anyone.
Integrity - Information cannot be altered.
Non-repudiation - Sender cannot deny his/her intentions in the transmission of the information at a later stage.
Authentication - Sender and receiver can confirm each Cryptography is used in many applications like banking transactions cards, computer passwords, and e-
commerce transactions.

Three types of cryptographic techniques used in general:


Which Encryption Types Involve Keys? 
Symmetric key and asymmetric key cryptography: make use of keys for encryption and decryption.
The hash function: doesn’t require the use of any key; instead, it takes an input of arbitrary length and provides the output in fixed length.
Hashing :is almost always preferable to encryption when storing passwords inside databases because in the event of a data compromise, attackers will not have access
to the plaintext passwords, and the website will not ever know the user’s plaintext password.

Transformation based methods: In this method, the original Biometric templates are morphed by applying Different transformations e.g., Cartesian, Polar etc. In Cartesian
transformation, the minutiae positions are measured in rectangular coordinates with reference to the position of the singular point by aligning x-axis with its orientation.
The coordinate system is divided into cells of fixed size. The transformation causes changes in the cell positions. In Polar transformation, the minutiae positions are
measured in the polar coordinate with reference to the core position.

Filter based methods: Cancelable Biometric Filter is a Convolution based method. Bloom Filters is a space efficient probabilistic data structure representing a set to support membership
queries. Bloom filter-based transformation of any binary feature vector generates irreversible Cancelable Biometric templates.

Hybrid methods: A hybrid encryption scheme is one that blends the convenience of an asymmetric encryption scheme with the effectiveness of a symmetric encryption scheme.
In this paper a hybrid cryptographic technique for improving data security during network transmission is proposed and their implementation and results are reported.
The proposed secure cryptographic technique promises to provide the highly secure cipher generation technique using the RSA, DES and SHA1 technique.

Multimodal based methods: Security is a major issue in all recent developing technologies, for that system deals with palm-vein and Iris (Biometrics inputs) from the user and then extract
the features like edge, texture using the feature extraction algorithm from both palm vein and iris captured images simultaneously and then apply cryptographic algorithm (Blow fish) to that extracted feature.

Machine and Deep Learning: With the reinvigoration or reinvention of neural networks, deep learning has become an extremely active area of research, and one that’s paving the way for modern
machine learning. process of teaching a machine to think like a human being to perform a particular task, without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning is the practice of programming computers to learn from data. we can use machine learning to solve problems that are very complex for non-machine
learning software. 
Deep learning: is the use of neural networks with many hidden layers and raw data as inputs. There are many deep learning architectures.

There are different types of system of machine learning:
Supervised: in this type of the data that you feed in the algorithm with the desired solution are referred to as labels, Supervised learning groups together a task of
classification.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): Multilayer perceptron holds many hidden layers; the neurons in the base layer i is completely connected to neurons in i + 1 layer. Such type of network is restricted
to have minimal hidden layers, and the data is allowed to transmit in one direction only.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): RNN is a logical choice if the input data is ordered sequentially, RNNs are
capable of handling long-range temporal dependencies.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The CNN has an excellent performance in machine learning problems. Specially the applications that deal with image data, such as largest image classification
data set (Image Net), computer vision, and in natural language processing (NLP).

Unsupervised: In this type you can guess that the data is unlabeled. And the most important unsupervised algorithms are Clustering, Association rule learning and
Visualization and dimensionality reduction.

this is an example; suppose you've got many data on visitor Using of one of the algorithms for detecting groups with similar visitors. It may find that 65% of your
visitors are males who love watching movies in the evening, while 30% watch plays in the evening; in this case, by using a clustering algorithm, it will divide
every group into smaller sub-groups

Online Learning: in this type of system can learn incrementally by providing the system with all the available data as instances groups or individually, and then the
system can learn quickly, we can use this type of system for problems that require the continuous flow of data, which also needs to adapt quickly to any changes.
Also, you can use this type of system to work with very large data sets.

AutoEncoder: learns how to efficiently compress and encode data then learns how to reconstruct the data back from the reduced encoded representation to a representation hat is as close to the original input as possible.

Supervised Learning : it uses data that is labeled. it does not require excess data for accuracy. Computational complexity is less, i.e., it is
simpler. it does not find patterns on its own from a dataset.
Unsupervised Learning: it uses data that is unlabeled. it requires excess data for accuracy. Computational complexity is greater, i.e., it is
less simple  it finds patterns on its own from a given dataset.

Deep learning: Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its
original goals: Artificial Intelligence, it’s a specific method of machine learning that incur- pirates’ neural networks in successive layers to learn from data in an
iterative manner. Deep learning is especially useful when you’re trying to learn patterns from unstructured data, it’s a branch of artificial intelligence and computer
science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, it is a systematic approach to leveraging advanced algorithms and
models to continually train data and test with additional data to begin to apply the most appropriate machine learning algorithms to a problem
Modern deep learning libraries allow you to define and start fitting a wide range of neural network models in minutes with just a few lines of code.
Deep learning neural networks learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs. This is achieved by updating the weights of the network in response to the errors
the model makes on the training dataset.

TensorFlow: Advanced machine learning concepts utilize the manipulation and calculus of tensors, TensorFlow is an open- source end-to-end machine learning library for
production and research.

Keras: Keras is an open-source neural network library with features like fast, modular, and user friendly in Python platform that works on top of TensorFlow or Theano.
Backend is a library within Keras to handle low-level computation as Keras is dedicated to advanced API wrapper.

Neural Designer:
is a deep learning tool which is used to implement analytics algorithms and make it easy to handle, it is designed with a graphical user interface that defines the
flow of work and gives accurate result. It is easy to handle as there is no programming or block diagrams involved.

Deep Learning Application:
Speech Recognition: Speech recognition uses deep learning concepts and becomes the foremost application of deep learning by cautiously using its power. the speech signal is
considered as short-time stationary signal or piecewise stationary signal.neural networks prove its efficiency in discriminative training. Neural networks
provide better results for short-time signals, it is continuous speech signals.

Deep Learning in HealthCare: Healthcare system is facing a new era by using advanced technologies and provide- Ing right treatment for right patient at right time. The deep learning
architecture applicable for healthcare system mostly falls on recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

Deep Learning Applications with Python:
One of the most desirable features of a programming language used for working with the deployment of deep learning models would be the ability for quick proto-
typing with minimal effort.

Deep Learning for Face Recognition:
Facial recognition is one of the most prominent biometric techniques used for identity authentication and verification, it is the identification of an individual
based on the photograph of their face. Deep learning methods, in the recent past, have had great success in the tasks of image recognition and classification.

Datasets:
The presence of a large-scale database is a necessary condition for the effective working of a facial recognition system. With saturation in the performance over
simple databases.

Deep Learning for Fingerprint Recognition: Fingerprint recognition refers to the identification of an individual based on the
comparison of two fingerprints. fingerprint recognition has had significant improvement over its former iterations.
Many of the solutions and research upon the fingerprint recognition problem revolve around the regular minutiae-based matching.

Related Work Survey:
Convolutional Autoencoder: It’s a tool for extracting features from images and compressing it to a lower
dimension called latent space that generated from input images, also it is used for random noise and random convolution. The random noise is extracted features which are random noise followed by median
filtering to get non-invertible templates. The Random convolution is based transformations make use of random kernels to convolve the biometric image or features to generate cancelable templates.
So, in this Fig below it shown the processing the input biometric image, and the features that extracted from the convolutional autoencoder.
Also, Random noise is added to the obtained feature vector which is then convolved using a random kernel for generating the cancelable template.

Pros: to secure a biometric identity, is creating a pseudo identity that distorted
in a non-invertible way by using a user specific (cancelable template).

Cons:
The identifiers directly are stored in the data base. so, if the attacker stole it, the identifiers can be used for illegitimate access to a system.
So, this is making the system under the risk and once lost, a biometric cannot be recovered.

Cancelable multi-biometric recognition system based on deep learning: The figure below presents the proposed approach pipeline, which is
divided into four steps: (a) detections of different facial regions; (b) extraction of deep features using multiple CNNs; (c) Using a fusion network to create a discriminative facial descriptor, and (d) using bio
convolving with random kernels to protect biometric data from various threats

Face, nose, eyes, and mouth regions are detected from the original face images Eyes, nose, and mouth are very effective regions on which several changes are
clearly noticed. These changes include laughing, closing eyes, opening mouth, or wearing glasses

Pros: drawback of using encryption with biometrics is the need to apply data decryption
that represents an attack point a single CNN model takes about 4 h in the training process. So, the proposed method suffers from a time consumption issue

Cons:
a bio-convolving method maintains privacy and security of biometric templates without affecting the recognition accuracy

Cancelable Biometrics Using Deep Learning as a Cloud Service: Cloud computing is a technique or a tool that allows you to store your sensitive data on a logical could know as a remote database. If an electronic device has access to
the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it. But here it had been developed by using cancelable Biometrics and Deep Learning to make
your sensitive data that stored on the cloud more secure and safe.

Pros:
high accuracy, non-repudiation, and permanency. Sense the cost is so high this method provides pay as you go techneqe which allow you to pay the cost of your work only .

Cons:
So complex so it may increase costs and data storage. The cost can go into two different categories the hardware cost and the software cost so that would be expensive.

Cancelable fusion-based face recognition: Biometric recognition refers to the automated process of recognizing individuals
using them biometric patterns. FR is considered as a promising option for human individuals’ identification improvement and People can access their accounts by secret codes, Users could be
identified by face, iris, fingerprint, blood, or DNA. DL learns multiple levels of representations including invariance of facial
expressions, pose and lighting. DL reshapes the FR research landscape with respect to datasets and evaluation protocols.
Biometric protection techniques that are used for preserving biometric authentication can be categorized to cancelable biometric techniques and
biometric cryptosystems.

Encryption and decryption of a class of face images with the same mask and a slightly different mask

Pros: doesn’t require multiple distributed and active co-operation of a person. Protection can be provided without degradation in the system performance

Cons: secret codes are unique, but they could be stolen or hacked by criminals or forgotten by users.


Attacks and Protection in Multi-biometric System: State of the art multi-biometric systems The biometrics framework has been divided into two categories depending on the number of attributes used, a unimodal and
multi-modal system where the system uses a single biometric attribute of an individual for identification and verification There are certain limitations associated
with these systems such as intra-class variation, spoofing attack , Failure to Enroll and Difference Between Classes To overcome these limitations, a multiple-
biometrics system was introduced. These are systems capable of using two or more anomalies to identify an individual. The accuracy of biometric system performance
can be increased by using a multi-biometric system instead of a mono-biometric system. Fusion plays a key role in multi-biometrics. It is implemented in five different levels 

Biometric systems may operate in two different modes, identification mode or verification mode. In the case of identification mode, the user is identified by comparing his input to
the templates already stored in the database, while in the verification mode, the identity of the user is checked against the claimed identity and checking whether the user is real or not.
In general, biometric systems are deployed in different application areas, such as commercial, for example, ATMs, distance learning and PDAs; government, for
example, social security, border, and airport security; and forensics, for example, cadaver identification, paternity determination, and criminal investigation.

Pros:
Basic information for all Users registered in biometric systems are stored centrally in the form database.

Cons:
Attacks on the template database in these systems can lead to failures or deterioration in system performance.

A Survey on Biometrics and Cancelable Biometrics Systems: The biometric traits possessed by everyone are unique and has the potential to recognize an individua, there are two phases in every conventional biometric

system: enrolment phase and authentication phase.

Compared to password or token-based authentication system, biometric system using fingerprint, iris, face, voice, etc. provides better security as people cannot lose or forget their biometric trait. But the advanced technology of today’s world
makes it possible to create a loophole in the biometric system. People leave their fingerprints on whatever they touch; hence one can easily steal the fingerprint and can even make an artificial finger using the stolen fingerprint.

The person’s face can be captured by the camera even from a distance without their concern The biometric template protection schemes are mainly divided into two

categories:
- Biometric Cryptosystem encrypts the biometric data to store it. Then, during authentication, the stored template is decrypted to do the comparison.
- Cancelable Biometrics matches the templates in the transmuted domain itself during the authentication phase. And provide the comparison decision in terms of Match or Non-Match.

Pros: The advantage using biometric traits are that biometrics cannot be forgotten, cannot get lost, it is permanent and difficult to forge, and It can prevent attacks on the database against the biometric applications.

Cons:
Finding an appropriate transformation function for cancelable biometrics is a complicated task. Standard non-invertible transformation functions do not operate properly with biometric data, the user either has to memorize a password/pin or to
bring the transformation parameter stored in the form of a token.
